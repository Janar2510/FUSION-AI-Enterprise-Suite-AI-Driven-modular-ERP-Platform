## Technical Details

### API Endpoints
- Chart of Accounts: `/api/v1/accounting/chart-of-accounts`
- Journal Entries: `/api/v1/accounting/journal-entries`
- Fiscal Years: `/api/v1/accounting/fiscal-years`
- Taxes: `/api/v1/accounting/taxes`
- Bank Statements: `/api/v1/accounting/bank-statements`
- Payment Terms: `/api/v1/accounting/payment-terms`
